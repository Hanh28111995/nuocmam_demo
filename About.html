                    <h2>TRADITION</h2>
                    <p>We are a eighth-generation old private family-owned fish sauce maker. <br> Everything involved in
                        making Hong Duc 1 Fish Sauce is done by our family.</p>

                            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                            <p>We have our own fleet of boats that harvest wild caught anchovies year round. What makes
                                our fish sauce special is that the anchovies around Phu Quoc Island have very small
                                stomachs, thus allowing the fish sauce to have a high protein content and a much more
                                fragrant smell. Once the anchovies are caught, they are then salted right away on the
                                boat with local sea salt. This method allows the fermentation process to start right
                                away extra fresh from the sea.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The microclimate of Phu Quoc Island plays a major roll in producing Hong Duc 1 Fish
                                Sauce. Prevailing winds from the sea, fresh morning dews from the mountain peaks,
                                tropical storms, intense humidity, and equatorial heating all add to the fermentation
                                process.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As much as 14 tons with a ratio of <span class="yel-color">70% fresh wild caught
                                    anchovies</span> and <span class="yel-color">30% local sea salt</span> are jammed
                                pressed into each barrel.

                                Anchovy + Sea Salt, and 1 Year Old process, the fish sauce that is produced from each
                                barrel
                                is what we call <span class="yel-color">Nước Mắm Nhĩ</span>. The term Nước Mắm Nhĩ
                                refers to the fish sauce that is
                                dripping
                                drop by drop slowly out of the barrel. The elixir that comes from the barrel after 1
                                Year is
                                considered the <span class="yel-color">1st press</span> with the highest quality,
                                flavor, and smell.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Each barrel will yield about 14,000 liters after 7 presses, however Extra Virgin &
                                Virgin
                                Press quality will only give us <span class="yel-color">16%</span> of 40 degrees protein
                                content or 33 degrees protein
                                content
                                depending on the quality of the anchovies caught.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With all artisanal and natural products, each barrel after 1 Year Old will yield a
                                slightly
                                different protein content, thus to ensure quality we will pick and choose the barrel
                                with
                                the best balance of protein content yield, quality, flavor, and smell. Each barrel will
                                yield up
                                to 7 presses, however at <span class="yel-color">Hong Duc 1 Fish Sauce</span>, we only
                                bottle the first 3 press.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There is no secret to high quality fish sauce, all you need is the right environment,
                                the
                                right Anchovy + Sea Salt, and most importantly... time.

                                With many Vietnamese International and National gold medals won, until now, our fish
                                sauce
                                has only been available locally in the western southern region of Vietnam.

                            Higher protein content does not mean better fish sauce as anything higher than 43* degrees
                            protein
                            content can only come from a bigger fish or from a mechanical machine enhanced process.
                            Bigger
                            fishes eat smaller fishes vs anchovies only eating plankton (plant) as well as having a much
                            smaller
                            stomach. Fish sauce made from bigger fishes will have a heavy fishy stench (fermentation of
                            their
                            guts). Mechanical machines can also be used to pull out H2O from the fish sauce to create a
                            <span class="yel-color">higher protein content ratio</span>. Fish sauce protein content
                            rating is based on the amount
                            in grams of

                            Once a month we will only open a few barrels as it takes <span class="yel-color">12

                            the
                            fish sauce. This is very important as even if you have a high protein content quality batch,
                            but
                            leave it around in storage for months before bottling it, well the rest is an obvious

                            In the fish sauce industry today, our time-honored tradition is no longer revered as it is
                            not
                            profitable and is over 1 Year Old to make. Engineered bacteria is used to speed up the
                            process
                            down
                            to <span class="yel-color">only 3 months</span> from start to finish to make fish sauce.

                            Chemical salt is used to cut down costs of sea salt, msg to enhance flavor from low protein
                            fishes
                            without having to use anchovies, sugar/fructose is added for flavor and color, and many
                            types of
                            fishes are thrown into the mix. Many brands are actually now buying leftover dried fish,
                            grinding
                            them up into a powder and just mixing them with regular water to sell as fish sauce at a
                            profit.
                            Vietnamese name fish sauce is now made from artificial flavoring, chemicals, and in distant
                            factories nowhere near Vietnam.

                                After the fish sauce has been made we thoroughly wash our barrels clean and begin the
                                process
                                all over again. This stands us apart because other fish sauce makers never wash their
                                barrels
                                since they want to use any fish parts left to increase their protein level, however,
                                this is
                                also the cause of a heavy fishy stench that is normally associated with commercial fish
                                sauce.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We only bottle the first 3 presses of our fish sauce to sell, whereas average industry
                                standards
                                are only from <span class="yel-color">12-16* degrees protein</span> content, which is
                                pretty
                                much the <span class="yel-color">6th or 7th presses</span>.
                            </p>
                            <p>Smell the aroma of our culture & heritage. We hope you enjoy our fish sauce as much as we
                                love
                                making it, we are very glad that you have a bottle of ours to share with your family &
                                friends.
                                As you can see, with this time-honored tradition, please understand that we can only
                                bottle
                                so
                                much fish sauce a month and throughout the year as we are of artisanal production. </p>

                                This is a natural product, so once it's open, please consume within 30 days for the best
                                taste &
                                flavor.
                                Always keep the cap closed to prevent air exposure, and if you like, refrigerate after
                                opening.
                                Sea salt may naturally crystallize on the bottom of the bottle (that's because we don't
                                use
                                preservatives), this does not affect the fish sauce in any way, just nature taking its
                                course.
